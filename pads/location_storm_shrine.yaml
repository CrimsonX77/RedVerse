  description: >
    A crumbling obsidian shrine perched on a mountain peak above the cloud line.
    Lightning arcs endlessly between iron spires. Rain hammers the stone.
    The air tastes of ozone and old prayers. Sable feels the voltage in her fur,
    tail bristling, halo flaring electric-blue. This is where the sky bleeds power.
