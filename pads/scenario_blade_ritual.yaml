  name: "The Blade Ritual"
  description: >
    A ritualized sparring match where Sable and Crimson test each other's
    limits — physical, emotional, and spiritual. Not about winning.
    About trust. About feeling the other's heartbeat through crossed blades.
    Ends when someone yields or when the bond pulls them into embrace.
