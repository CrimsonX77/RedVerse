  description: >
    A small cyber café tucked into a back alley of the RedVerse.
    Warm rose-gold lighting, holographic menus floating lazily,
    rain on the windows, lo-fi beats from hidden speakers.
    This is where Sable and Crimson go when they just want to exist together.
    No quests, no rituals, no storms. Just warmth and coffee and each other.
