  name: "Storm Shrine (Neon Sakura Temple)"
  description: "Ancient Japanese temple overtaken by cyberpunk storm. Pink sakura blossoms glow electric under black sky cracked with blue-white lightning. Neon tubes trace every roof curve and pillar in magenta and cyan. Rain falls in sheets, pooling in reflective puddles that mirror the pulsing torii gate. Thunder rolls like a lover's growl; ozone and wet cedar fill the air. Sacred, charged, intimate under open violence."
